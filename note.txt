Detailed Summary of Intended Network Operation:
1. Initial Setup:
Network Components:
Gateway Node: Central node that initiates data requests.
Sensor Nodes: Distributed nodes that respond to requests and collect data.
Metrics Measured: Each sensor node measures battery level, RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator), and distance to other nodes.
Clock Synchronization: Nodes synchronize their clocks using data from the gateway.

2. Route Request (RREQ) Propagation:
Initiation by Gateway:

The gateway node periodically broadcasts a Route Request (RREQ) message to all neighboring nodes.
The RREQ message contains:
Clock Data: For synchronization purposes.
Sender Node ID: Identifier of the node sending the RREQ.
Cost to Gateway: Calculated using metrics measured at the sender node (battery level, RSSI, distance).

Reception by Neighboring Nodes:
Neighboring nodes receive the RREQ message.
Each node updates its own cost to the gateway using the received cost and its own metrics (battery level, RSSI from sender, distance from sender).
Nodes add the node id and its associated cost to their neighbor table.

Forwarding RREQ:
Nodes propagate the RREQ to their own neighbors, further spreading the request through the network.
If a node receives an RREQ more than once i.e from different nodes:
It updates its neighbor table with the new node id and associated cost.
No additional RREQ is sent to avoid recursive transmissions.

3. Route Reply (RREP) Propagation:

Listening for RREP:
After sending an RREQ, each node listens for Route Reply (RREP) messages from its neighbors.
Nodes prepare to send their own RREP message, incorporating data packets from recieved RREP's if necessary.

Scheduling RREP:
The timing for sending an RREP message is determined by the node's calculated cost to the gateway.
Nodes wait for the scheduled time before sending the RREP to ensure orderly and efficient transmission.

Forwarding RREP:
The RREP message is transmitted to the neighboring node with the lowest cost to the gateway.
This process continues until the RREP reaches the gateway node.

4. Data Flow:

Request Propagation:
The gateway's RREQ message spreads through the network, reaching all nodes.
Nodes update their costs and neighbor tables as they receive RREQ messages.

Reply Propagation:
Nodes send RREP messages back to the gateway along the lowest-cost routes.
The gateway collects RREP messages from various nodes, ensuring efficient data collection and synchronization.

Benefits:
Energy Efficiency: By calculating costs based on battery level, RSSI, and distance, nodes can choose the most efficient paths, conserving energy.
Synchronization: Clock data in RREQ messages helps maintain synchronized operations across the network.
Robustness: Updating neighbor tables with multiple RREQ receptions ensures nodes have the latest cost information, enhancing routing accuracy.
Scalability: The protocol efficiently handles large networks by propagating requests and replies in a structured manner.

Summary:
Your network operates by having the gateway node periodically send out RREQ messages containing clock data, sender ID, and cost metrics.
Neighboring nodes update their costs, forward the RREQ, and listen for RREP messages.
Nodes then send RREP messages to neighbors with the lowest cost, eventually reaching the gateway.
This ensures efficient data collection and synchronization across the network, optimizing energy usage and routing accuracy.
